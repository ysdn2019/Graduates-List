description: Service dogs provide valuable companionship and aid that many desperately need. Unfortunately, there are few organizations that train them, and those that exist only send out to individuals in very specific circumstances. Self-training is an option many find themselves undertaking. Trainr is an app that aims to help those training their service dog.

caption1: Trainr is an app that helps individuals track and manage their service dog’s training. With tasks organized by age, category, or difficulty, trainer’s can work through the vast amount of tasks their service dog is required to master in order to be allowed in public spaces. Trainr contains outside support options that will provide easy access for individuals to get help and ask a question for unique problems they may have. The app also discourages fake service dog users by requiring photographic evidence once your service dog has mastered a new trick. Trainr proves the validity of your service dog as well as allows you to share and review your success through the app’s photo journal. Those are just some of the features Trainr will provide to take away the stress of training so individuals can spend less time researching and worrying, and more time working together with their service dog.

subtitle2:
caption2: This is the first app of its kind and that made for some interesting challenges. The biggest challenges with creating this app were how to present and include the vast amounts of information and requirements needed when training a service animal. There is a lot to consider when training a service animal and the laws and expectations change drastically from location to location. With that in mind, it was important to try to include as much as necessary without it becoming too complicated and without it deviating from the purpose of the app.

subtitle3:
caption3: Through research, and several classes and group discussions, a picture began to emerge for what this app should be, and for what it should include. By doing many different exercises in class I had many different ideas as to how to handle these requirements. Individuals using the app needed to be able to record and review tasks learned, review what has yet to be learned, receive help learning how to train, and needed a way to prove the validity of the training. The design of this app gives an inviting, friendly feeling. It uses yellow to suggest a warm feeling, and pink to instill a sense of confidence and passion. The major audience for those self-training a service animal are women and for that reason, the app uses more feminine colours. The app is meant to be friendly and clear to its users, so it uses brighter colours and rounded edges. Raleway was chosen to be a friendly, elegant typeface with plenty of personalities while still being clean and open. It is designed to be easy to use with plenty of capabilities and options without it being cluttered or overly complicated.

subtitle1:
caption1: Nobody expects the worst to happen to them and even though we all know theoretically the worst can happen to us, most people shrug it off as unlikely and leave the worry out of their mind. They either believe due to experience, age, or skill, that they will not overdose. Unfortunately, there is a huge variety of factors that affect what a person’s body can handle and that can change daily. All it takes is one small mistake or miscalculation and that could be the end. This campaign aims to get individuals to carry Naloxone on their person and carry it for the worst case scenario. Even though that danger exists most opioid users have heard those warning a million times before, and they no longer mean anything to them. #expectsurprises takes a different approach than just restating the risks to opioid users. When trying to encourage opioid users to bring naloxone #expectsurprises uses a “satisfying” video to catch the users attention. After watching the satisfying video for a few seconds, the video then becomes very unsatisfying. The video then calls for users to, “expect surprises” as things don’t always go the way you thought they would. By using targeted advertising on social media sites like Facebook, and Instagram, users who are most at risk receive a message through one of the campaign’s many videos and are reminded to carry naloxone.

subtitle2:
caption2: The greatest challenge was trying to find a way to connect with my target audience. Most of the individuals using opioids are not in a place where they are ready for outside sources to tell them to stop doing drugs. They already know the risks of the drugs but to them, the risks have not outweighed the “benefits”. This campaign does not try to tell individuals to stop but instead tells them to bring Naloxone. The campaign couldn’t come at the audience with an accusatory tone or an overly dreary tone. It needed to be different and intriguing to those who have heard warnings hundreds of times. By using funny almost prank content, the campaign aims to catch users attention and make them think about bringing Naloxone kits.

subtitle3:
caption3: "Due to the challenge of this project the tone of this project had to be bright, and humorous. It couldn’t rely on fear or guilt-tripping. It needed to stand out and therefore the entire project uses bright colours and white space. The mark above is the mark for the campaign. It is an altered Naloxone molecule where a heart has been switched out for parts of the molecule. This instills the idea that Naloxone can give you back your life and can prevent you from losing your heartbeat forever. Overall, the project took a very light tone from the copy to the images and icons. There are two main aspects to this project, the social media campaign and the website where users can go to find kits, donate, and learn more about Naloxone and the opioid crisis. Red is the Brand’s primary colour with blue as a close second. Red was selected due to the importance of the topic as well as its association to danger. This issue is very important and very serious, and while the major tone of this project is fun and humorous, it is important to inject the importance of this issue through the use of colour. Red is also very reminiscent of blood and is used in first aid and on naloxone kits. The website uses open white space and opens letting to give off the bright tone of the project. It uses icons, photography from the campaign, from the naloxone kit, and other promotional merchandise to further remind individuals of the campaign’s message."

description: When someone aims to use self-defense, they may only use plus one of the force being placed against them. Plus one varies widely from person to person and depends dramatically on the individual and situation. In the same way, safety techniques cannot always be applied the same way.

subtitle1:
caption1: Force Plus One is about individuals using their full potential and going beyond what they believe they are capable of. “There is more to you than you know”, that is exactly what Force Plus One is here to show individuals and that is where the iceberg motif came from. The iceberg is made from a combination of three shapes, the combination of different elements coming forward to make a single symbol represents the combination of many different forms of martial arts, hand to hand combat, feminist empowerment, non-violent communication, and many different teachers and training partners that eventually lead to the creation of a fully realized personal safety curriculum.

subtitle2:
caption2: For this brand, it was difficult to narrow down its target audience because ultimately the client wishes to reach women from all over the world. Currently, the brand caters to English speaking individuals who have access to a computer and wifi. Eventually, the brand is hoping to expand beyond just English and expand to other languages so as many people as possible can have access to these safety tools. After several discussions, we were able to narrow down who exactly Force Plus One needed to target. Generally, Force Plus One targets those between the ages of 18-34. It caters to women who are relatively new to self-defense or safety training and aims to help those who are hoping to learn skills that could help save their life. Once we were able to narrow down the target audience we were able to create several user stories that aided in developing the mark, the tone, and the visuals."

subtitle3:
caption3: "Force Plus One is a brand that will rely heavily on self-made videos coming from the client. It, therefore, must be simple and easy to follow so that it does not require special software to create the videos. This brand relies on icons and texture images. The icons are useful tools that the client can use throughout the videos. They are easy to insert and are effective at getting her message across without it looking cheap or overly cheesy. The marble texture used in the brand helps to illustrate the idea of combining several different skills and pieces of knowledge in order to create a new, effective course. In the same way, textures such as marble and mixed paint can further demonstrate the combination of many different things to create something beautiful. The brand's colours are blue and red. Blue to push the visual of the iceberg but also to visualize the idea of confidence, unity, stability, and calm. It says that Force Plus One is a place where one can come to be part of something that will bring out your inner confidence and it will bring calm to your life. Red helps to remind individuals of the importance of these skills. It pulls your eye to the message being delivered and reminds the user that there is danger and this course is here to teach you to deal with it. Red is also the final stage in the colour codes of awareness, a principle taught by Force Plus One to help individuals understand the difference between levels of vigilance needed for different levels of danger. The colour red is the highest level of vigilance because it signals the highest level of danger."
