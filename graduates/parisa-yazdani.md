description: After studying vlog culture and its broader impact on societal understandings of entertainment, reality and work, I created this book series which turns popular YouTube vlogs into short novels. Once the audio and visual context is removed, we are confronted with the raw content and left to question the value of these highly popularized videos.

description: Rebrand for the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO). The logo riffs off the natural shapes of the geometric letterforms, which alludes to childrenâ€™s building blocks; a symbol of innovation, creativity and imagination. The geometric shapes from the logo are then used to create illustrative figures which are integrated into the brand.

description: An advertising campaign promoting healthy alternatives to unhealthy means of coping with stress; something most of us must deal with on a daily basis. I wanted to get viewers thinking about exercise as an antidote for stress, not just as something we are "supposed to" do.
