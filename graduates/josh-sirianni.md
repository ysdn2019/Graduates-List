groupmembers:
category: Typography
mediumdimensions: Digital
description: Humiles is a print-focused, ecological typeface that solves the limitations inherent in eco-friendly type design. It has been carefully crafted to not only reduce ink consumption, but paper consumption as well; while remaing as practical and versitile for designers as itâ€™s non-ecological counter-parts.
