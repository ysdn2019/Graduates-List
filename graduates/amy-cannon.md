bio: After always having an a strong affinity for art, Amy entered into Sheridan College’s Art Fundamentals program, and through that, stumbled her way into the world of design and YSDN. Coming from a background in visual arts, Amy trys to explore that type of creativity through her design, while keeping a minimalistic style throughout her work. Occam’s Razor guides her way of thinking on terms of design – “simple solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones”. While as designers are tasked with the overused phrase of finding solutions to problems, Amy trys to do this in the simplest way possible. Over the past 4 years, while she has developed a strong passion towards type, editorial and book design, she constantly trys to keep growing and educating herself as a designer in a fast paced world.

title: Paperclip
groupmembers:
category: Typography
mediumdimensions: Typeface Design
description: “Paperclip” is a multi-dimensional display typeface. Consisting exclusively of upper-case characters, it was modeled (unsurprisingly) after the shape of a traditional paperclip. Each character has been multiplied and offset alongside its companion, while disappearing before the point of intersection between layers, allowing for a 3D effect in a 2D design.
