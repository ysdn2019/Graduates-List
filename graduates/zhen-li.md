title: Data Knows
groupmembers:

mediumdimensions:
description: The project explores users knowledge of how data is being used. I used projection based photography onto human principles characterizing unconsented episodes of how data conducted research in AI, robots, information design and physical computing. Found material was determined through a series of visual investigation in marrying users data within the body. Knowledge of  how data is being used is powerful.
