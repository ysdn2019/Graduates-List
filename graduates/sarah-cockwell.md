bio: Sarah is a fourth year YSDN student that focuses on branding, communication and editorial design. She is interested in the creative communication part of design by producing beautiful designs for the eye. She is a hard working, organized designer that is obsessed with making lists and owning almost everything that is yellow or light blue. Sarah is passionate about design because it allows her creative freedom to flow when it comes to challenges and projects. When she isn’t designing, she enjoys her time off by spending time with her friends and her two dogs. She also enjoys taking photography, eating good food and drinking matcha tea lattes. Sarah is excited about graduating and jumping into the design field this summer. She hopes to work in downtown Toronto after graduation, eventually traveling to different counties to continue her work in design.

description: The Dirty Shoe Co. is a theoretical online pop up shop that sells end of life cycle shoes in order to make consumers aware of their over buying behaviour. Through this project I want to make global consumers aware of the shoe industry’s carbon footprint through a form of erratic realization.
