bio: >-
  Sarah is a fourth year YSDN student that focuses on branding, communication
  and editorial design. She is interested in the creative communication part of
  design by producing beautiful designs for the eye. She is a hard working,
  organized designer that is obsessed with making lists and owning almost
  everything that is yellow or light blue. Sarah is passionate about design
  because it allows her creative freedom to flow when it comes to challenges and
  projects. When she isn’t designing, she enjoys her time off by spending time
  with her friends and her two dogs. She also enjoys taking photography, eating
  good food and drinking matcha tea lattes. Sarah is excited about graduating
  and jumping into the design field this summer. She hopes to work in downtown
  Toronto after graduation, eventually traveling to different counties to
  continue her work in design.
