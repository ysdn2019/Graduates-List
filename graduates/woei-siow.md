bio: Edward Siow is a YSDN student with a focus on information design and data visualization. He also has a preference for print-based design. Edward’s interest in design started during high school, when he was taking art classes, although his knowledge of design was still limited during that time. However, it was when he entered YSDN that his experience with design started to expand. During his time in YSDN, Edward learned about many design disciplines and was given the chance to develop and hone his design skills. Other than design, Edward’s interests include reading and drawing, which he likes to partake in during his spare time when he is not designing.
