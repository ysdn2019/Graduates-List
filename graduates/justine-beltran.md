bio: Justine is an optimistic and eager designer with an interesting take on the world. She takes her experiences and uses them, learns from her mistakes and inserts a piece of herself into her work wherever she can. With an emphasis on print, she enjoys explorations, unconventional methods of brainstorming and needs to work on being more confident in her work and her abilities. Branding has been her strong point throughout these past four years but has a newfound interest for marketing. She sees design as not only a brand but also an experience. Justine wants to help make the world a more beautiful place.
