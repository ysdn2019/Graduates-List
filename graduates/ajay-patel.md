The festival celebrates experimental expression, avant-garde sound-craft and crossover media, with an emphasis on creative self-expression.

description: Ontario Cannabis Store's (OCS) current brand misses the mark in connecting with the its audience. I therefore took on the challenge to rebrand OCS by repositioning its visual passivity to a more explicit and dynamic spirit of the existing cannabis culture and the one in which it will permeate.
