His recognizable passion for challenges, humour, technologies and cultures has allowed him to embrace the creative condition as a continuous state of exploration and self-discovery.

description: Electric Eclectics is a small non-commercial festival on a giant farmland in Meaford, Ontario. The festival celebrates experimental expression, avant-garde sound-craft and crossover media, with an emphasis on creative self-expression. My role was to reestablish the festival’s identity through a holistic design system, including a poster, web/mobile, booklet, and ephemera designs.

description: The process of regaining our emotional footing in the midst of struggle is where our courage is truly tested. Repositioning nihilism in contemporary youth culture, I developed an experimental book that provides uniquely visual and self-reflective help through a re-introduction to the act of expression to abate youth angst.

description: Ontario Cannabis Store's (OCS) current brand misses the mark in connecting with the its audience. I therefore took on the challenge to rebrand OCS by repositioning its visual passivity to a more explicit and dynamic spirit of the existing cannabis culture and the one in which it will permeate.
