caption3: Telling the story from a creative perspective, Palette encourages consumers to cook, have fun in the process, and feel good about their efforts towards the environment. Palette’s logo is a representation of a meal plate, and each part of the circle contains a different food item. With numerous logo combinations, the dynamic identity symbolizes that individuals are the artist of their own meal plate, along with the endless possibilities of cooking.
