bio: If you are wondering how to pronounce her last name, it’s We-ja-ya. She is a multidisciplinary designer who feels that the most enjoyable part of design is developing ideas on paper and collaborating with other people to create thoughtful and aesthetic work. As a natural observer, she is inspired by her environment, human interactions, friends, and family. Aside from her many hobbies–such as eating, travelling, and playing sports, to name a few–branding, typography, and print are the areas of design that interest her most. She is a lover of laughter, adventure, and learning, and if you give her 5 minutes of your time, she promises that any conversation with her will be unforgettable.
