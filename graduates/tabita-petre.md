bio: >-
  Taby’s journey as a creator was strongly influenced by her experience as an
  immigrant. When she lived in Romania as a young creative explorer,  she never
  thought she’d end up studying design in Canada. Her love for visual
  communication began with fine arts, and through the fast evolution of the
  world wide web, she slowly started dipping her toes into online communities.
  This is how she learned to use Photoshop, and eventually ended up in the YSDN
  program (learning how to use and do many more things than Photoshop, haha)!
  She is passionate about using design to give a voice to those who feel like
  they might now have one otherwise.
