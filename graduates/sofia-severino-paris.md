bio: Sofia Severino Paris tries to look beyond the horizon, to the places that few are willing to go. Limitations are her favourite because she loves to break through them. Her success in this has allowed her to discover new possible successes and she will forever go beyond the realm of expectations. Sofia believes that design lives outside of the screen and she strives to find the irregular. What makes her different isn’t something she fears but rather something she embraces. If it is not new, she will make it new.

mediumdimensions:
description: The product design of Gem Nails is inspired by art that is collected from consumers. People can send in their art and concepts and Gem Nails will use it as part of the product’s design which then creates an interactive connection with consumers and a “one of a kind” feel to the product itself. In the end, a Gem Nails product would contain a nail polish bottle inside the packaging while the outside is a piece of art inspired by/ that incorporates a consumer’s submission.

description: The installation Intention was created for the new garden space at Sheridan College at Trafalgar. The final product is a model of what the full-size piece could look like. In this project, I had plenty of creative liberties, as long as I was able to laser print my model.
