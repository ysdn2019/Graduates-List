bio: Asifa’s interest in the arts began with her visits to different art galleries as a child. Over time, her interest developed into a variety of creative skills. She took on the challenge of learning photography and composition in school, and this introduction to the digital arts played a significant role in discovering graphic design. Her passion for photography, creative problem solving and design allow her to create thought-provoking solutions in the form of her design pieces. Asifa’s work is a clever display of minimalism with an artistic undertone; at times she employs an emotional appeal to make her work relatable. She feels that becoming a designer allowed her image-making skills and creativity to have a practical purpose. Instead of treating design as a response to a rubric, she prefers to construct experiences that are impactful and memorable to the intended audience while staying true to its functionality.
