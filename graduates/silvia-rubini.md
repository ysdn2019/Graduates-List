subtitle1:
caption1: Unlike, your typical pasta box which is only made to be used once, this box was created with a secure lid, that you can open and close. At the front of the box you will find the name of the pasta, as well as how many grams are inside the box and how long the pasta will take to cook. The circular logo uses handwritten typography giving the design an authentic feeling.

subtitle2:
caption2: On the back of the box you will find a long window, where the consumer is able to see how much pasta is actually inside the box along with a recommended recipe. On the side panels the nutrition label, ingredients, and information about the company was added.

subtitle3:
caption3: Since, Oh Mio Dio is a product made in Italy, it includes two languages, English and Italian. Our goal for retail packaging with an artisan pasta maker is to capture Italian tradition to where it all started — with simplistic design and modernity.

title: Childhood Obesity in Canada
groupmembers:
category: Information Design, Interactive, Print
mediumdimensions:  8″ x 11″ Pamphlet with a 22″ x 32″ back poster & iPad Publication
description: As childhood has changed, children’s health is changing along with it for the worst. More people need to be aware of why childhood obesity is a problem and how it can further impact children’s health in the future, which was achieved by creating a printed pamphlet and tablet publication.

subtitle1: Visual Design
caption1: When envisioning the colour scheme and feel of childhood obesity, teal and cream were used as neutral colours. In contrast, the colours red and yellow were used to signify the dangers and risks of childhood obesity, thus highlighting important information throughout the pamphlet. I also wanted to use a bright colour scheme which would relate to childhood.

subtitle2: The Layout
caption2: When advocating to parents, I chose to create a printed pamphlet to convey the information. Although, the poster on the back is targeted towards a wider audience. Overall, my design solution brings awareness to childhood obesity by providing parents with the essential information needed to make a change in children’s health achieved through a clean, simple, and organized design layout.

subtitle3: Tablet Publication
caption3: Due to the limitation of print, I did not want to overwhelm my audience with too much information. However, with the tablet publication users are able to gain a deeper understanding of childhood obesity, without feeling overwhelmed. This was achieved through the use of pop-ups and additional interactions with important information.
