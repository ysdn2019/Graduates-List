subtitle2: Selwyn Condensed Alphabet and Construction
caption2: Selwyn Condensed has a unique relationship with the trees. The width and weight of the typeface paired with its loose spacing mimics the sparse, young forest which surrounds Trent University.  Some letterforms, like the lowercase y displayed above, have been more heavily influenced by the natural forms of the Peterborough forest.
