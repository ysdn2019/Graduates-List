bio: Erin is driven by a balance between the simple and the unexpected, the serious and the experimental, and the perfect and the playful. As a concept-first designer, her impulse is always to avoid cliché, innovating on past aesthetics to create a unique approach. In her work, Erin often explores the tension created by the interaction between the human and the technological. She is influenced by the ability of speculative worlds, particularly in science fiction, to simultaneously communicate big ideas and connect emotionally with an audience. Outside of design, Erin is a competitive highland dancer, loves to read fiction, and drinks way too much tea.

description: A custom typeface evoking the contrast and harmonious union of the technological and the biological, as sharp lines transition into curves. Posthuman draws inspiration from the typography used on the covers of many 1970’s science-fiction films and novels, paying homage to these sources while modernizing a retro aesthetic.

mediumdimensions:  Editorial Design, 6.5" x 8"
description: A print publication seeking to engage readers in various perspectives of thought to broaden their understanding of science fiction’s most enduring question: What does it mean to be human? Sector 01 investigates the theme of autonomy as it relates to artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, questions of free will, and more.

subtitle1: Sector 01 uses a monochromatic colour scheme to differentiate articles, and features the custom typeface “Paladin” as the masthead, pull-quotes, and drop caps. The letterforms, built around a standard grid, evoke a rigid type-style that might be used in a high-security bunker.

title: What Is This?
groupmembers: 
fields: Packaging, Print, Typography
mediumdimensions: Packaging and Typeface Design
description: A game for the facilitation and examination of meaning-making. What Is This? asks participants to interpret meaning into shapes randomly generated through the stacking of plexiglass cards etched with bitmap images. These interpretations lead the participant to ask: If what we perceive isn’t inherent to reality, then what is reality, really?

subtitle1: A custom typeface was developed for this project using the structure of the bitmap images as a base.
