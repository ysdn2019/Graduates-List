caption1: For young working adults or recent graduates, learning new skills can be highly beneficial to their professional career and valuable to their personal growth. However, between costly courses at certified institutions and limited online tutorials, it can be challenging to find the right resource to learn new skills. Further, busy full-time work schedules and physical proximity to educational resources can make it more challenging to achieve learning goals. Collab aims to bridge this gap by automatically matching the user’s preferences/interests to available mentors and workshops according to their location, availability and price range.

subtitle1: 
caption1: At first glance, this piece appears as an ordinary piece of embroidery however through the use of Augmented Reality technology the meaning behind the motifs is revealed, thus fostering a gradual understanding between the viewer and the visualization. The very core of this work is to explore our tactile sense and uncover ways to embed information about ourselves derived from technological devices (digital space) into the physical space surrounding our bodies. The year long process of developing this work was led by one primary inquiry: How might we use data visualization to generate empathy in the viewer and elicit a response at an emotional level? How can we project our identities onto our surrounding objects and use them as a vehicle to narrate our personal stories?
