bio: Michelle is a multidisciplinary designer passionate about communicating ideas and stories to develop meaningful experiences and spark joy. Her approach in design mixes research, play and exploration - her curiosity drives her to ask questions, look for challenges, and engage in design thinking, she then plays with and explores possible avenues of dissemination, visual outcomes, and potential solutions. With her love of UI/UX, interaction, branding, book design and illustration she hopes to communicate, influence and have an impact on others whether it be to get people thinking or making someone smile. She studied abroad in Germany during YSDN to broaden her horizons and explore design outside of Canada - she seeks to forever learn and grow. In the rare occasion she’s not designing, you’ll find her watching cat videos, listening to podcasts or visiting new coffee shops and restaurants.
