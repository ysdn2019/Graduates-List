subtitle1: The Population
caption1: By 2050 the worldâ€™s population will likely increase by more than 35 percent. To feed the population of 9.7 billion people, crop production will likely need to double. Why? Production will have to far outpace population growth. There will not be enough available space to supply for the growing population unless the world works together for a solution.

subtitle2: Risks
caption2: There are many risks towards the environment when it comes to farming and agriculture. Farming has caused numerous risks to our planet. From food insecurity for developing countries, soil degradation from harmful plants, rising ocean levels from global warming, all the way to overproduction of food. These problems are damaging our planet and must be controlled.

subtitle3: About Cash Crops
caption3: A cash crop is a crop that is grown directly to be sold on the market, rather than a crop that is grown to consume personally. These crops are often abused and overproduced so much that they can damage the soil they are grown on. Often when soil is damaged the land will simply be abandoned. The only concern to the farmer is where more cash crops can be planted in order to sell more.
