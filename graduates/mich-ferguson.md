description: The project's goal was to create an extreme sports brand that successfully represented women in a confident and competitive manner. To establish a reason to be interested in the company I created a strong visual identity system that would allow this niche brand to stand out in an oversaturated market.

description: For this musician themed booklet, I chose to design a "zine" for the artist Social Distortion. To accomplish this, I researched the band's past artworks, show flyers, posters, and the punk communities’ fanzines. My final design brings together many of these elements to create a DIY styled, polished zine.
