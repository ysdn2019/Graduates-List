subtitle1: Problem Space
caption1: Purchasing tickets to high-demand events with your groups of friends can be a tedious experience. Organizing a friend get-together to go to high-demand events has a lot of frustrations such as: who is committed to go, who is paying for everyone/splitting the cost, and what is everyone's budget? Different event-goers have different priorities, which makes the experience from purchasing tickets to attending the event much more complex for groups. This project aims to tackle on the user problems and complexities of purchasing tickets to attending events. The challenge is: "how can we create a seamless event ticketing experience by catering the needs of each individual within the group?"

subtitle2: Goals and Features
caption2: The goal of the project is to create a seamless experience for purchasing high-demand tickets by designing a calm group purchasing experience, purchase tickets with multiple people, share seat reviews. The application features discovering and sharing events to friends, inviting friends to form a group for an event, viewing seat reviews, splitting the cost/paying altogether, assigning seats, and transferring digital tickets safely to group members. A secondary feature allow users to share photos of events from where they are sitting to allow ticket buyers to view seat reviews and previews of the seats.

subtitle1: Visual Exploration
caption1: The three poster designs begins with visual exploration and research. The exhibition encompasses the themes of technology, futuristic, digital, architecture, artificial, hybrid, geometry, sci-fi, abstract, and utopia. The visual language that I intend to communicate is a combination of technology, nature, and art through the use of abstract, representational, and symbolic concepts. I aim to establish a feeling of futuristic, technological, and hybrid emotions and juxtaposing it with natural, free-flowing elements.

Event information, location, and preview of the installations are displayed on the website that markets the event to the online audience members. The website's visual language uses a mixture of photography and collages in an interactive space.

subtitle1: Problem Space
caption1: Stress, tiredness, unhealthy diets, and poor lifestyle habits are a few of the many problems that adults face in their busy lives. Transitioning into adulthood, young adults begin to take care of themselves and maintain their own routines and habits. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is extremely important, and it can be often neglected by poor self care. Proper maintenance helps improve overall health and satisfaction. Unhealthy habits includes: lack of sleep, unhealthy diet, forget to remove makeup before sleeping, environmental factors, not washing your face, etc. Lack of maintenance of skincare can lead to breakouts, wrinkles, rashes, hives, skin stress, visible effects of aging, and illnesses. How can we improve skincare maintenance & integrate skincare routines and better lifestyle choices into user's everyday lives?

subtitle2: Solution & Data Visualization
caption2: The goal is to educate individuals about their skin health by designing a smart device that detects skin condition and problems on the surface and beneath the skin. The data visualization features six main skin conditions, visualized in a web of colours that represent each type of condition. The mesh of colours in a circular shape compares each condition according to the hue, light/dark, saturation, size, shape of the colour. The visualization provides an overall view of a user's skin condition.
