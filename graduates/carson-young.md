subtitle1: The Problem
caption1: The process of asthma treatment is complex. Using an inhaler can be daunting as it is very specific, has several confusing steps, and the breathing technique is often unusual and uncomfortable to the user. This results in only 50% of users knowing how to use these inhalers properly. For children, parents have to purchase additional air chambers to assist them with taking the medication efficiently, making it very inconvenient. Additional problems of inhalers include social stigmas of carrying an inhaler, not knowing when an inhaler runs out of medicine, and parents having no way of knowing if their children are using their medication correctly.

subtitle2: The Solution
caption2: Oble is an easy to use, friendly smart inhaler designed for children (aged 5-12) that combines the standard inhaler with the spacer into a single product. With it's companion app, Oble can help assist children taking the medication more efficiently without any prior assembly, and is embedded with bluetooth technology that allows parents to track the device's usage and how well their child is doing on an everyday basis. The final product has a friendly tone with removable silicon characters allowing children to use their asthma medication without worry of being looked down upon. Instead of being embarrassed about having asthma, they can get the right treatment confidently whether at school, home or anywhere else they go.

subtitle3: The App
caption3: The Oble companion app is designed for parents to help administer their child's health. By tracking their breathing efficiency (tidal volume) with each use, the app also offers breathing practice to help getting better with using Oble if the child is having any problems.

description: Our team was approached by the Design department at York University to create a new platform for their equipment rental program. The solution, called Toolbox, allows an easy equipment booking process for both students and staff, while creating a more informed and organized management system for administrators.

subtitle1: The Problem
caption1: The YSDN equipment rental program at York University allows students to select and rent out equipment to help complete projects requiring additional resources such as cameras, tripods and audio equipment. However, this system and process has yet to be digitalized, resulting in confusion policies, ineffective methods of enforcement, and unreported damage to equipment. As a group, we were tasked with creating a digitalized system for not only the students to book online, but also help the staff (also called lab monitors) and administrators easily oversee and run the program.

subtitle2: The Solution
caption2: Toolbox is a fully online web platform designed for the YSDN program that allows an easy equipment booking process for students, a smoother check in and checkout experience for staff, and a more informed and easily run equipment system for administrators. The platform allows students to book items online in advance of pickup, eases the checkout and return flows for lab monitors, and creates an efficient and standardized system to ensure all equipment is accounted for administrators.
