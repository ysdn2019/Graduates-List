bio: As a developing designer, artist, and writer, it is in Allana's nature that her thoughts are riddled with both visual and linguistic notions. She believes that aesthetics and conceptuality are both integral to the process of thinking and creating. She will always be learning how to convert her abstract thoughts into finished, thorough pieces while aiming to make each piece of her work memorable and thought provoking.
