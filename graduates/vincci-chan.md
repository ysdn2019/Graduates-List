subtitle1: Logo Design
caption1: Buddy is a positive, cheerful, and friendly brand name that is easy to remember. The design is intended to evoke imageries of warmth and friendliness with therapy animals. The logo design considers the goal of the service, which is to bring love and warmth, hence the use of the heart shape. The “tail” is designed with the Bézier curve, and it represents the animals. The “eyes” add the most important touch that brings an interesting look and feel.

subtitle3: Interface Design
caption3: The relationship between humans and animals can have a strong therapeutic effect. We believe that having the chance to touch and see animals up close at home can give people a appreciation for animals. Not only that, therapists and therapy animals can accompany clients to face and manage mental problems.
