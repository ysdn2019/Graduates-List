bio: Caitlin is a young passionate graphic designer that is personally interested in UI/UX design, data visualization and motion design. While in the BDes program, she developed her own style and found that the digital spectrum of graphic design is where her heart is at. Her typical style is “round”, as her designs are friendly and inviting; her designs tend to have a roundness or soft edge to them. She’s always curious and willing to learn new things or take on new challenges. Her approach to design is to provide education on various topics and aggregating data to support decisions and learning in daily life. Her view on design is that it should be functional to the user and understand its own role in influencing the user’s experience, which why she focuses on education and aggregating data as they are two areas that are functional in a user’s daily life.

description: Butterfly is an experimental data visualization. Focusing on the butterfly effect, the visualization evolves based off of the choices I made in creation of it as an ever-changing composition. The word “butterfly” is used to affect the composition in order to examine visualizing soft data.
