bio: A thinker, hand letterer, boba slurper, music lover, pixel pusher, and hands-on hustler. Katreena is a creative problem solver with a strong focus on UI/UX design. Her ambition is to create valuable human experiences while dabbling her creative strategy through supporting interests in identity and typography. Katreena’s work is rooted in research, experimentation, and iteration. Motivated by problem solving, she enjoys getting her hands dirty and diving deep into the process from concept to execution. When not designing, she can be found playing the piano, flipping through clothing racks, and hunting for the next ramen gem spot.

subtitle1: Joining a Karaoke Room
caption1: Using a casting system, such as Google Chromecast or Apple AirPlay, users are able to join into one karaoke room by entering the room code casted on the TV. Once all users are joined into one room, everyone can browse all songs and sing.

subtitle2: Access to Karaoke Songs
caption2: jammin’ takes a new perspective to karaoke in that a physical copy of the song book does not have to be passed around a group of people. Instead, all users in the karaoke room will have access to all songs and be able to browse the list freely on their own mobile device. This way, it gives a fair chance for everyone to browse through songs and participate. Once a user finds a song they would like to sing, they can queue the song (which will appear on the TV screen). Users also have the option of saving their favourite songs so that they don’t always have to look for their favourite karaoke songs. Instead, users can head over to their favourites section and quickly queue in the songs.

subtitle3: Gamification
caption3: jammin’ incorporates a gamification aspect to the karaoke experience where once a user sings, they will be scored on how well their performance was. Scores eventually accumulate and everyone is able to see who is in the lead based on their performances. In the Tournament Style mode, rounds will consist of calling out opportunities of a solo or duel. In cases where there is a duel, users can vote who they thought won the duel on their mobile device. While users are able to see the updated scores after every round, there is a final score that determines the scoreboard of the whole game.

subtitle2: ABC Series

The floral edition of ABC Series is specifically dedicated to letterforms that introduce aspects of floral.

description: Flux is a custom typeface created from brushstrokes of a marker. Deriving from the definition of “flux”, the typeface resembles the action of flowing with its loose, organic strokes.
