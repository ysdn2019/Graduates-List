bio: Alessya is a fourth year YSDN student. Alessya's passion for design began around the age of eight where she was cutting up all of her mother’s magazines and creating what she liked to call “a working masterpiece.” Since then, her divine passion for design has simply grown stronger each day as she hopes to create a more artistically inclined world! Her design strengths can be seen through branding, print and editorial. When she is not designing, she enjoys travelling around the world and familiarizing herself with diverse cultures. She relies on fitness as a get away from stress which helps expand her creativity and perspective on life. She hopes to land a job at an agency Downtown, Toronto and branch off into other large cities and countries like Australia, New York, Los Angeles and wherever else the design world can take her.
