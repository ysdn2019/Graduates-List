bio: Hira is a multidisciplinary artist and designer who specializes in print and communication design. She is passionate about creating engaging work across multiple platforms and uses design as a vehicle to communicate an experience. While she enjoys the aesthetics of design, she likes to similarly focus on designing for social change and having a positive impact on society. Hira also implements her visual arts background into creating with other mediums: from drawing, to crafting, to sewing and costuming. Most of the time, though, you’ll find her playing the latest video games.
