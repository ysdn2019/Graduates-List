bio: Lucy began her journey as a designer barely knowing anything about design. The four years of YSDN has taught her the basics of becoming a designer, allowing her to form a sense of understanding and perspective in regards to the field. However, this is only the beginning. She’s still hungry to learn more, as she gets closer to the reality of it. She’s interested in venturing to find out what “good design” really is, and what a good communicator looks like. Other than that, you’ll be able to find Lucy often taking a nap in her bed, on her laptop at a library sipping on a cup of bubble tea, or at Starbucks brewing coffee and attempting to make latte art.
