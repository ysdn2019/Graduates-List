bio: David Luong is an aspiring product designer that looks to understand human behaviour on an extremely deep level. He is passionate about behavioural science and is fascinated by why people do what they do. Wanting to also help others realize their own aspirations and act upon them, he believes that this drive of his comes from his mentors, teaching him that anything is truly possible if the right mindset is applied. David strives to reflect that same message through writing about his personal experiences, teaching, and or speaking about his personal story. Believing that the most beautiful experiences and lessons are always on the other side of fear, he is constantly seeking discomfort and tries to push others out of theirs as well.

The proposed application tracks their breathing efficiency (tidal volume) with each use, remaining dosage, and offers a practice mode in case of any usage problems. Additionally, detailed reports based on previous usage are presented and can be exported within the application.
