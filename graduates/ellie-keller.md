bio: Ellie focuses on using a research-infused design process to build empathy and create work that is relevant and nuanced. Her curiosity for understanding the interplay of thoughts and emotions first led her to study psychology. Now, she uses her background in psychology to achieve a more holistic understanding of problems and needs. She loves to dive deep into problems in order to understand the relationships between people and the designed world. Currently, Ellie has been using a variety of mediums to explore how design can interplay with feelings and emotions in order to spark discourse.

description: Bio(me) is an ongoing exploration of the changing definition of what it means to be human. Microscopic images of my own microbiome are juxtaposed onto parts of us that we traditionally recognize as “human” in order to challenge our sense of self. Bio(me) aims to use design to make an invisible, obscure thing—our microbiome—visual and interesting in order to bridge the gap between science, society, and culture.
