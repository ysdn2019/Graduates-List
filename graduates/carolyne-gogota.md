bio: Carolyne is a socially driven people-person who believes that little changes have great impact. She sees design as a vehicle of understanding, communication, and ultimately, as a catalyst of cultural possibilities. When creating new designs, she tries to make abstract concepts easier to understand through organic visual forms and structured typography. When Carolyne is not designing, she can be found watering her plants or trying out new recipes.

subtitle1: Dutch Wax
caption1: This article brings light to the history and origins of the widely used Dutch wax fabric and patterns. Along with sharing its history and use, an infographic runs along the body text that portrays the process of creating Dutch wax fabrics. I used the letter “c” from the typeface Montserrat to create the display type; this coincides with the idea of being cut from the same cloth.

subtitle2: Exploiting or Borrowing?
caption2: Concepts of exploitation and borrowing are contrasted by using type as image. Pull quotes borrow one character from non-western scripts while larger visuals are comprised of several scripts taken out of context. These characters frame the text to lead readers through the content of the spread.

description: My thesis project explores how introducing culture-specific perspectives in post-secondary design education can aid the visual communication of junior designers in a culturally diverse society. I’m currently making deliverables for a one-day workshop that consists of a workbook, infographic, and visual exercise. Come see the finished product In Real Life!

subtitle1: Visual Essay
caption1: In addition to a literature review, I conducted visual research of my own work and evolution as a design student. I found that a lack of exposure to culturally diverse perspectives in design led me to believe the that scope of effective design was very small. With exposure to culturally diverse perspectives, I may have recognized my style much earlier and would have been more open to experimentation.
