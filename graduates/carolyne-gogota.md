bio: Carolyne is a socially driven people-person who believes that little changes have great impact. She sees design as a vehicle of understanding, communication, and ultimately, as a catalyst of cultural possibilities. When creating new designs, she tries to make abstract concepts easier to understand through organic visual forms and structured typography. When Carolyne is not designing, she can be found watering her plants or trying out new recipes.

description: Exploring how interactivity can enhance learning experiences, I crafted a book of pull tabs, flaps, pop-ups and more. I hope to show that discovery and simple delight don’t have to end in elementary school. This design is a homage to Peterson First Guide to Clouds and Weather.

description: My thesis project explores how introducing culture-specific perspectives in post-secondary design education can aid the visual communication of junior designers in a culturally diverse society. I’m currently making deliverables for a one-day workshop that consists of a workbook, infographic, and visual exercise. Come see the finished product In Real Life!

subtitle1: Visual Essay
caption1: In addition to a literature review, I conducted visual research of my own work and evolution as a design student. I found that a lack of exposure to culturally diverse perspectives in design led me to believe the that scope of effective design was very small. With exposure to culturally diverse perspectives, I may have recognized my style much earlier and would have been more open to experimentation.
