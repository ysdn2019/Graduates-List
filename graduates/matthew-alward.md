bio: Matthew is a buoyant and motivated designer, who takes every opportunity he can to learn and further develop his skills. He entered into this program with a background in the visual arts and very little knowledge of what being a designer truly meant. However, over these past four years, he has grown immensely, both in terms of technical skill and in his design thinking abilities. Heâ€™s discovered that design is not just about the final product, but also the in-depth research and exploration it takes to get there. His approach to design has always been highly focused on simplicity and cleanliness. He believes that the simpler a project is able to be, the more effective it is at reaching its audience. However, it is also important that there is rational thought behind every aspect that is utilized.
