bio: Matthew is a buoyant and motivated designer, who takes every opportunity he can to learn and further develop his skills. He entered into this program with a background in the visual arts and very little knowledge of what being a designer truly meant. However, over these past four years, he has grown immensely, both in terms of technical skill and in his design thinking abilities. He’s discovered that design is not just about the final product, but also the in-depth research and exploration it takes to get there. His approach to design has always been highly focused on simplicity and cleanliness. He believes that the simpler a project is able to be, the more effective it is at reaching its audience. However, it is also important that there is rational thought behind every aspect that is utilized.
