bio: Melosha Ratnasingham’s design journey began in a small yearbook class in high school, when she realized that there was more to graphic design than posters and CorelDraw. Over the years, design has taught her to use both digital and print based mediums to create experiences for people. She is passionate about making, experimenting and learning from the design process while problem solving using creative solutions and producing meaningful work through collaborative experiences. Melosha approaches the process through a variety of perspectives with an open and curious mindset allowing her to explore different possibilities. She is learning that failure is the path to success and hopes to make clever and joyful experiences for others in the near future.
