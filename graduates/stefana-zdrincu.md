description: Pin-illism is the name of the pushpin package design that is created to look like a Pointillism painting. The package is made of a thick brown textured paper to mimic the texture and color of wooden frames to hang paintings. The paper frame holds the ‘canvas’ where the pins are pricked together to create an image. A flap with a hole sits at the top back of the box so that the package can be hung just like a real painting, in stores and at home.

subtitle1:
caption1: The back of the package includes a small, fun and educational blurb about Pointillism to let customers understand the idea, the two colours used which are represented by painting swatches, and the quantity of pins.

description: A pedometer with a twist! This app measures the number of steps taken using animals. Normal walking apps are boring and can be un-motivational, which is why this pedometer acts like a game where the user unlocks new animals the more they walk, and gain points. Reward systems are known to work to motivate people to do things, and this app wants to aim for a healthier lifestyle.
