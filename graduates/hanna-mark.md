bio: Hanna is a graphic designer, who absolutely loves to create art and illustrations on the side. Hanna is inspired by nature and loves to create from what she sees in the beautiful Canadian landscape. It is such an interesting process morphing the art of graphic design as well as visual art and mixed media together to create something unique that has not been seen before. It is so important to stay spontaneous and throw yourself into a design, and think about the technical aspects of it later. That way you end up with a unique design that you can then focus on making into something substantial later. Hanna hopes to be able to continue designing unique works of art throughout her career.

subtitle1: Box Cover Design
caption1: This is the design I decided to go with for the front of the box that carries the Tarot Cards. The octopus on the front was chosen as the spirit animal for the project, and will be seen as a logo as well as appear on the back of each card.

subtitle2: The Fool, The Magician, and the High Priestess
caption2: These are 3 of the Major Arcana cards in the Omniscient Tarot deck. The Fool, numbered 0 in the deck, is one of the most important. Every card tells the tale of the fools journey through life, as he/she has not experienced anything yet. The struggles, happy times, inspiration, sadness, etc. These cards are an example of what the Major Arcana cards look like.

caption3: These four cards are the Queen cards of each of the suits in the Minor Arcana. The Minor Arcana is made up of 56 cards; 4 suits with 14 cards in each suit. The Suit of Wands, the Suit of Pentacles, the Suit of Swords, and the Suit of Cups. This image gives an insight into what the cards in the Minor Arcana will look like.

subtitle1: Typography Element
caption1: This article is about a psychic person giving a reading to someone over skype, my idea was that all of the thoughts and ideas the psychic was getting from the reading were flowing into the conversation, so the words swirling in reflected that and complimented the article.

subtitle2: Illustration Element
caption2: This article is about a haunted forest in Romania, and so I decided I would hand paint a forest scene to compliment the article.

subtitle3: Photography Element
caption3: This article is about 4 different haunted places in the world you could travel to. The main focus is the background photography, so I just tried to compliment the imagery.
