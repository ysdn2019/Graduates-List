bio: Tasneem is a multidisciplinary designer who aims to create enjoyable experiences through her work. She gathers inspiration from everyday experiences and inconveniences which she then aims to bring awareness to through participation and engagement. Tasneem is always trying to explore new ways of design thinking and problem solving. Her favorite way to approach a project is by determining the problem at hand and who is the solution being created for? User personas are often something she looks forward to in any project as this is where she truly gets to know the audience she is designing for. Tasneem is passionate about UI design, Graphic design, motion, and using her designs to bring awareness. When not designing you can catch her sending a spam of memes to her friends DMS and catching up on the latest BTS Run episodes. P.S. If you have any dank memes send them my way to @tasneembtas.

subtitle3: Therapy sessions right in the app 
caption3: It’s hard to find the time to sit down and talk. Haven allows users to book therapy sessions on their own time right through the app. Once they’ve been set up with a therapist users are able to decide whether they want to continue more sessions with the same therapist or try out a new one. If they need to talk to someone right away there is also an option to talk to a trained professional at any moment.
