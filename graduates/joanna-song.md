subtitle1:
caption1: The final app prototype consists of 4 main features: Dictionary, Draw/Write, Camera, and Customize. 

The Dictionary feature is a standard dictionary structure of typing out a word in either English or Korean to obtain definitions and its context. 

The Draw/Write feature allows users to test out writing the language and/or mimic words they see on various signs. The app reads and provides a list of possible combinations from what the user drew.

subtitle2:
caption2: The Camera feature detects and directly translates the words written on products, street signs, books, and more, on a real-time camera, while also having the option to choose a picture from their photo library.

I also added a Customization feature which does not contribute to the entire learning process, but adds to the personalization and familiarity of the experience itself. it allows the users to customize the main hub to fit their own existing room, or make the room look and feel like their home.

subtitle3:
caption3: Although there is more work to be done, these features come together to effectively allow travellers to enjoy the new language and culture of a foreign country with quick and accessible ways of obtaining translations, while also making the experience familiar and personal.

subtitle1:
caption1: I love stripes! What more can I say? In order to express my love for the pattern, I created an illustration heavy book, inspired by geometry, nature, and my everyday life.

subtitle2:
caption2:Each focal visual element in the illustrations points to, faces, and/or moves toward the next page to enhance that idea of movement and allow for viewers to smoothly transition from one page to the next.

The accordion folding technique allows for the story to be told in a linear format that can also be viewed as a whole, as well as be viewed like a normal bound book.

subtitle3:
caption3: The cutouts make the experience more dynamic and makes the viewers become curious of what was behind the story itself, which reveals an array of stripe patterns, which in turn brings the focus over to the pattern itself.

subtitle1:
caption1: Hangeul (한글) is the Korean word for “Korean”, and Bojagi (보자기) is the Korean word for the piece of square fabric that wraps virtually any object that fits inside. Bojagi is one of the prominent methods of carrying and wrapping various items used in Korean culture and it is still used today.

subtitle2:
caption2: Users are able to experience the Korean culture as they see the pattern of Korean imagery, feel the texture of the bojagi, and wrap up their learning tools with it. This process allows for the learners to physically interact with the language even before they begin to learn.
image3: /assets/work/song_joanna_project3_web_support3.png
subtitle3:
caption3: The supporting box for the books also holds pencils, erasers, and flashcards of the basic Korean alphabet essential for learning.

The box’s second life is a portable workstation with small doors for the utensils which allow users to customize their own collection of tools to make the experience of learning a language personal.
