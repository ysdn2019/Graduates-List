bio: Jordan's art journey began in Ottawa at Canterbury Highschool for Visual Arts. At Canterbury Jordan learned the main visual principles to become an artist. Then transferring that knowledge to YSDN at York University Jordan was able to further develop my skills. Learning lots about design principles, typography, editorial, web design and much more Jordan was able to develop a unique style by blending art and design into one. His goal as a young designer and artist is to share my work with people and help people realize that we are not alone in life. His art represents the joys and downs in life because Jordan truly believe you need to have sadness in your life to know what happiness is.

description: For workshop I decided to break the boundaries of making an app, or a book and develop a personal brand for my style of design/art. The project consists of a web store, a gallery show, collaborations, and a clothing line.

subtitle1: Live Mural
caption1: Featuring my work in a gallery is one thing, but the designer in me wanted people to interact with the idea of no limits. The solution to my interest in interaction was a 16-foot mural that was open to anyone who stepped into the show.

subtitle2: Sunday Laundry
caption2: A conceptual statement piece, the purpose of this project is to challenge the traditional format of a book—and explore how narratives are delivered.
By combining poetry with fashion, the idea of self-expression through worn apparel is preserved, meanwhile the poems on each piece convey elements of this shared narrative. 
This experimental “book” explores the theme of love—and the wide range of emotions that fall on its spectrum.

subtitle3: Featured Pieces
caption3: Just a collection of different pieces I did that lead to the final brand/show. Within the collage you can see a poster for the show, experimenting see-through images, sketchbook designs, and some of the shirts for Sunday Laundry.

description: A font created with the characteristics of neon signs and gothic letters. After meshing the two I created a poster series that show the expression of the font, by connecting and altering the letters to make a unique harmony.

subtitle1: Luminous Font
caption1: Here is the complete lettering of the font, the reason the font lettering isn't complete is only due to time, since the project was completed in 4 months. As you can see each letter follows a series of rules, from the angles used and spacing between each line in order to keep the font consistent throughout.

subtitle2: Poster 1 - Wonderful
caption2: The poster is to highlight the use of the font and how creative it can be used.

description: The magazine is about the word “Oh," it is used to express a range of emotions. So each issue will involve a story that express multiple emotions. I decided to use my photos I took in California this summer of Salton Sea. It is a town that is abandoned and while exploring through the homes I expressed many different emotions towards the town and I thought it would be a good magazine.

subtitle1: Images For Magazine
caption1: The images used through the magazine were taken in California of an abandon city. Just being in that physical place shook me because it was in such a beautiful scenery, yet no one lived there.

subtitle2: Type Spreads
caption2: Here are some of the spreads that featured typography. I wanted the magazine to represent difference and shock, so the type could be seen as usual or different.
